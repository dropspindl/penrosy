An aperiodic tiling is one that can cover an infinite plane with no gaps, but NEVER REPEAT! It is always different. 
The most famous aperiodic tilings were discovered by Roger Penrose in the 1970s. 
Of the Penrose tile sets, the most common is P2, the kite and dart. 

With the addition of a simple rule that you can't insert a kite into a dart such that you make a rhombus, 
these two shapes can be laid like a mosaic in a never-ending, never-repeating pattern.

## Penrosy Overview

Penrosy is an app that allows you to place Penrose tiles on a canvas to create beautiful artwork! 
(Temporary note for instructors: I don't think I will be able to have them lock/click into place, so instead 
people can lay them wherever and will have to eyeball it)
