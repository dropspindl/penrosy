# Penrosy

Penrose tiling apps generally focus solely on the math, ignoring aesthetics completely. Some don't even have any color at all!

Just because Penrose Tiles are mathy, doesn't mean they can't be beautiful too! I created Penrosy to allow people to explore the beauty of Penrose tiles in an open-ended fashion

## Penrose Tiles- Background
 

An aperiodic tiling is one that can cover an infinite plane with no gaps, but NEVER REPEAT! It is always different. 
The most famous aperiodic tilings were discovered by Roger Penrose in the 1970s. 
Of the Penrose tile sets, the most common is P2, the kite and dart. 

With the addition of a simple rule that you can't insert a kite into a dart such that you make a rhombus, 
these two shapes can be laid like a mosaic in a never-ending, never-repeating pattern.
