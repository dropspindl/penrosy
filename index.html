       <h2>Penrose Tiles</h2>
       <p>One of the oldest problems in geometry asks which shapes (or sets of shapes)
           can tile a plane, 
           locking together with copies of themselves to
            cover a flat area in an endless pattern called a tessellation.</p>

        <p>It's easy to see how squares, triangles, and hexagons are tiling shapes, 
            but pentagons are much harder. It has recently been proven that there are only 
            15 pentagons (discovered between 1918 and 2015) that can do so. 
        </p>
        <img src='./images/pentagons.png'/>
        <p>In the 1970s, Roger Penrose discovered various series of tiles 
            (related to pentagons in angle) that were APERIODIC. 
            This means that you could lay these tile sets forever and the pattern would never repeat!
            One such set is the kite and dart, which we use here.
         </p>

            Martin Gardner wrote a really great booklet on Penrose tiles 
             and you can read it for free here</a></p>
         <br/>
        <h2>Legal Moves</h2>
        <p>Although Penrosy allows you to lay tiles however you like, 
            making an actual Penrose tiling requires following some rules. 
            You can't just put a kite into a dart like so to create a rhombus. 
            Rhombuses tile periodically! 
            Instead you have to line up the imaginary lines shown below.
        </p>
        <img class='small-img' src='./images/arc.png'/>

        <p>It turns out there are only seven appropriate ways to lay the tiles 
            when you follow this placement rule!>
